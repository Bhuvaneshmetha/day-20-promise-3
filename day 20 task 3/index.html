    <h1>Historical classes of cocktails</h1>
    <p>➣Cobbler – traditional long drink that is characterized by a glass 3⁄4 filled with crushed or shaved ice that is formed into a centered cone, topped by slices of fruit
    <p>➣Collins – traditional long drink stirred with ice in the same glass it is served in and diluted with club soda, e.g. Tom Collins
    <p>➣Crusta – characterized by a sugar rim on the glass, spirit (brandy being the most common), maraschino liqueur, aromatic bitters, lemon juice, curaçao, with an entire lemon rind as garnish
    <p>➣Daisy – traditional long drink consisting of a base spirit, citrus juice, sugar, and a modifier, typically a liqueur or grenadine. The most common daisy cocktail is the Brandy Daisy. 
        Other commonly known daisies are the Whiskey Daisy, Bourbon Daisy, Gin Daisy, Rum Daisy, Lemon Daisy (the non-alcoholic variant), Portuguese Daisy (port and brandy), vodka daisy, 
        and Champagne daisy. The Margarita and Sidecar (cocktail) are both variants of the Daisy; both use the simplest form of the specification (base spirit, citrus juice, and liqueur) 
        with triple sec as the modifier; the former uses tequila as the base spirit and lime juice, while the latter uses brandy as the base spirit and lemon juice.[2]
